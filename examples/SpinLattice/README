# Brief description of contents of SLDexamples

bccFeSLD       # bcc Fe with MM, LL and MML coupling. Uses cutoff in LL interaction

	       # Variants available in the runbccFe*.sh scripts

	       # Gronbech-Jensen-Farago velocity-Verlet solver (initial and/or measurement phase)
	       # Canonical velocity rescaling (measurement phase)
	       # Fixed-point iteration implicit midpoint solver (measurement phase)	

DimerLD        # Dimer LD, atomic or physical units, zero or finite lattice damping

DimerSLD       # Dimer SLD, with zero lattice damping and zero Gilbert damping,
               # using velocity-Verlet or fixed-point iteration implicit midpoint solver
               # optional use of point group symmetries for the couplings

TetramerSLD    # Tetramer SLD, physical units, with different MML coupling,
               # with zero lattice damping and zero Gilbert damping

Triang2DSLD1   # triangular Lattice LD or SLD

TrimerSLD      # Trimer SLD, atomic units, with different MML coupling,
               # either of Aiji type or of Aijk type.
               # optional use of point group symmetries for the couplings

To-do and status of examples 20200504

1. Add Python matplotlib scripts for plotting

2. The setup of Aijk in TrimerauSLD3site and TrimerauSLD3siteSym differs.
Both examples are possibly proper and correct, but mmlfile3site could be
changed to give the same mapping as mmlfile3site.sym.

3. For bccFeSLD, the sym flag was earlier set to 1, but this is redundant
given that the input files contain the full set of couplings.
